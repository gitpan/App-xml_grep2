=head1 NAME

  xml_grep2 - grep XML files using XPath

=head1 SYNOPSYS

B<xml_grep2> [I<options>] I<xpath_expression> [I<FILE>...] 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<xml_grep2> is a grep-like utility for XML files.

It mimicks B<grep> as much as possible with the major difference that
the patterns are XPath expressions instead of regular expressions.

When the results of the grep is a list of XML nodes (ie no option that
causes the output to be plain text is used) then the output is normally
a single XML document: results are wrapped in a single root element 
(C<xg2:result_set>). When several files are grepped, the results are grouped
by file, wrapped in a single element (C<xg2:file>) with an attribute
(C<xg2:filename>) giving the name of the file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c>, B<--count> 

Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching  lines for each  input  file.

=item B<--help> 

Display help message

=item B<-f> I<NUM>, B<--format> I<NUM>

Format, of the output XML

The format parameter sets the indenting of the output.
This parameter is expected to be an integer value, that specifies
that indentation should be used. The format parameter can have
three different values if it is used:

If I<NUM> is 0, than the document is dumped as it was originally
parsed

If I<NUM> is 1, xml_grep2 will add ignorable whitespaces, so the
nodes content is easier to read. Existing text nodes will not be
altered

If I<NUM> is 2 (or higher), xml_grep2 will act as $format == 1 but
it add a leading and a trailing linebreak to each text node.

xml_grep2 uses a hardcoded indentation of 2 space characters per
indentation level. This value can not be altered on runtime.

=item B<-g>, B<--generate-empty-set>

Generate an XML result (consisting of only the wrapper) even if no result
has been found

=item B<-H>, B<--wrap>, B<--with-filename> 

Force results for each file to be wrapped, even if only 1 file is grepped.

Results are normally wrapped by file only when 2 or more files are grepped

When the C<-t>, C<--text> option is used, prints the filename for each match.

=item B<-h>, B<--nowrap>, B<--no-filename> 

Suppress the wrapping of results by file, even if more than one file is grepped.

When the C<-t>, C<--text> option is used, suppress the prefixing of  filenames  
on  output  when  multiple files are searched.

=item B<--html> 

Parses the input as HTML instead of XML

=item B<-L>, B<--files-without-matches> 

Suppress  normal  output;  instead  print the name of each input
file from which no output would normally have been printed. Note
that the file still needs to be parsed and loaded.

=item B<-l>, B<--files-with-matches> 

Suppress  normal  output;  instead  print the name of each input
file from which output would normally have  been  printed. Note
that the file still needs to be parsed and loaded.

=item B<--label> I<LABEL>

Displays input actually coming from standard input as input com-
ing from file LABEL.  This is especially useful for  tools  like
zgrep, e.g.  gzip -cd foo.xml.gz | xml_grep --label=foo.xml something

=item B<-M>, B<--man> 

Display long help message

=item B<-m> I<NUM>, B<--max-count> I<NUM>

Output only I<NUM> matches per input file. Note that the file still needs
to be parsed and loaded.

=item B<-N> I<PREFIX>=I<URI>, B<--define-ns> I<PREFIX>=I<URI>

Defines a namespace mapping, that can then be used in the XPath query.

This is the only way to query elements (or attributes) in the default namespace.

C<XML::LibXML::XPathContext> needs to be installed for this option to be available.

Several B<-N>, B<--define-ns> options can be used

=item B<-n> I<STRING>, B<--namespace> I<STRING>

Change the default namespace prefix used for wrapping results. The default is C<xg2>.
Use an empty string C<-n ''> to remove the namespace altogether.

If a namespace (default or otherwise) is used, it is associated to the URI 
C<http://xmltwig.com/tools/xml_grep2/>

=item B<-o>, B<--original-encoding> 

Output results in the original encoding of the file. Otherwise output is in UTF-8.

The exception to this is when the B<-v>, B<--invert-match> option is used, in
which case the original encoding is used.

If the result is an XML document then the encoding will be the encoding of the first
document with hits.

Note that if grepping files in various encodings the result could very well be 
not well-formed XML. 

Without this argument all outputs are in UTF-8.

=item B<-q>, B<--quiet>, B<--silent> 

Quiet; do not write anything to standard output. Exit immediately with zero 
status if any match is found, even if an  error was detected. Also see the 
B<-s> or B<--no-messages> option.

When also using the C<-v> or C<--invert-match> option, the return status will
be an error if all the document root (or all the entire document) have been
matched. 

=item B<-R>, B<-r>, B<--recursive> 

Read all files under each directory, recursively

=item B<--include> I<PATTERN>

Recurse in directories only searching file matching I<PATTERN>.

=item B<--exclude> I<PATTERN>

Recurse in directories skip file matching I<PATTERN>.

=item B<-s>, B<--no-messages> 

Suppress error messages about nonexistent or  unreadable  files.

=item B<-t>, B<--text-only> 

Return the result as text (using the XPath I<value> of nodes). Results
are stripped of newlines and output 1 per line.

Results are in the original encoding for the document.

=item B<-V>, B<--version> 

Print the version number of xml_grep2 to standard error.
This version number should be included in all bug reports (see below).

=item B<-v>, B<--invert-match> 

Return the original document without nodes matching the pattern argument
Note that in this mode documents are output on their original encoding.

=item B<-x>, B<no-xml-wrap>

Suppress the output of the XML wrapper around the XML result. 

Useful for exemple when returning collection of attribute nodes. 

This option is activated by default when the C<-v> option is used (use 
C<-X> or X<--xml-wrap> to force the XML wrapping in this case)

=item B<-X>, B<xml-wrap>

Forces the use of the XML wrapper around the output, when C<-v> is used. 

=item B<xl>, B<liberal>

Use XML::Liberal to parse broken XML. XML::Liberal needs to be installed
for this option to be available

=back

All options names that use '-' can also use '_' instead, eg you can use
C<no-xml-wrap> or C<no_xml_wrap>.

=head1 Differences with grep

There are some differences in behaviour with grep that are worth being mentioned:

=over 4

=item files are always parsed and loaded in memory

This is inevitable due to the radom-access nature of XPath

=item the file list is built before the grepping start

This means that warnings about permission problems are reported all at once before the
results are output.

=back

=head1 BUGS, TODO

=over 4

=item namespace problems

When a namespace mapping is defined using the B<-N>, B<define-ns> option, if this prefix
is found in a document, even bound to a different namespace, it will match.

When a prefix is defined using the B<-N>, B<define-ns> option, if the prefix
is found in a file, then the one defined on the command line will not match for this
file

=item Encoding

Avoid outputing characters outside of the basic ASCII range as numerical entities

Allow encoding conversions

=item XML parsing errors

Deal better with malformed XML, probably through an option to skip malformed 
XML files without dying

=item Be more compatible with C<grep>

Do not build the list of files up front. Report bad links.

=item package properly, more tests, more docs...

=back

=head1 XPath

see http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/ for the spec

see http://zvon.org/xxl/XPathTutorial/General/examples.html for a tutorial

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item xml_grep2 //h1 index.xhtml

Extract C<h1> elements from C<index.xhtml>. Do not forget the C<//> or
you will not get any result.

=item xml_grep2 '//h1|//h2' index.xhtml

Extract C<h1> and C<h2> elements from C<index.xhtml>. The expression needs 
to be quoted because the C<|> is special for the shell.

=item xml_grep2 -t -h -r --include '*.xml' '//RowAmount' /invoices/

Get the content (B<-t>) of all C<RowAmount> elements in C<.xml> files in the 
C<invoices> directory (and sub-directories)

The result will be a text stream with 1 result per line. The B<-h> option
suppresses the display of the file name at the beginning of each line.

=item xml_grep2 -t -r -h --include '*.xml' '//@AmountCurrencyIdentifier' /invoices/

Get the value of all C<AmountCurrencyIdentifier> attribute in C<.xml> files 
in the C<invoices> directory (and sub-directories). Piping this to C<sort -u>
will give you all the currencies used in the invoices.

=item xml_grep2 -v '//p[@class="classified"]' secret.xml > pr.xml

Remove all C<p> elements in the C<classified> class from the file C<secret.xml>

=item xml_grep2 -t -N d='http://perl.org/rss/1.0/' '//d:title' use.perl.org.rss.xml

Extract the text of the titles from the RSS feed for use.perl.org

As the title elements are in the default namespace, the only way to get them is to
define a mapping between a prefix and the namespace URI, then to use it. 

=item GET http://xmltwig.com/index.html | ./xml_grep2 --html -t '//@href' | sort -u

Get the list of links in a web page
